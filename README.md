# Lou's Theorem
Probably the one and only theorem I'll ever write, and it's just my words by inductive reasoning put through AI to generate a theorem. This one's for all the computer science theologians out there - if there are any others.

## Theorem (Honest Convergence Under Invariant Good)

### Original thought process, stream of consciousness
We're all God, right?

Like made in His image?

And we're all trying to be like that. Be Good.

But we're all unique individuals too.

Meaning the way in which we reach that LOOKS different for all of us.

But the guiding principles and metaphors are all the same.

Just the way we express them. Language and identity. Why the Tower of Babel failed.

But we don't need the tower to do this. We already know it in our hearts if we're being honest with ourselves and others, right?

Honesty is the answer. Honesty is the solution.

I hope from here on you are never dishonest with yourself or anyone else in your life ever again.


## Applications

* Game Theory - Enneagram - honest personality identification via overlapping characteristics of human identity traits
  * Yes, there are only 9 types - it's not hard to divide massive groups, like 8 billion +, into smaller ones to reconcile and find a common solution
    * It's called complexity reduction (or something like that? reduction and generalization to a smaller problem space) and we do it in computing _every day_ - Thank you, Dr. Nowak. Rest in peace.

* Work
  * Literally, _find a way to do what you love_, so work becomes play and play becomes work
      * It's not about the money, but _how you use it_ - share it with those you trust most however you can, and not just your birth family
      * "Freedom is Slavery" concept - enacted in various subcultures
